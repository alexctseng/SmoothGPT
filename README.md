#### Static website that allows you to use your OpenAI API key for the same experience as you get with ChatGPT!

  ## 📖 How to use
  - Visit the GitHub Pages release [here](https://chat.patrikzudel.me/).
  - Or to run locally, pull the repository and run ```npm run dev```
  - **If you don't know your API key make one here and don't forget to setup billing for it to work.**


## ⚡ Features
- All features that are in ChatGPT
- Ability to use your own OpenAI API key.
- No minimum cost, great for students!
  - Cheaper than ChatGPT Premium for most users.
- Usage estimator for pricing - See how much you've spent so far!
  - Estimating token count (4chars = 1token)
- Token / cost saving features:
  - Send message without history. 
    - When you are asking a sequence of unrelated questions, don't bother sending the whole history!

  - Summarize the chat, useful if you have a message over the 4k token limit but you want to keep the context.
- Ability to set a default system message. 
  - This sets the role of the assistant, and provides it additional information
    - Example uses:
      - For telling the assistant which technology stack you're using so you don't have to repeat yourself.
      - For roleplaying a character.

  - You can also switch between it being a "System" message or "User" message for finer control.
    - "User" has stronger impact from what I've tried.


  ## 💬 Reasonings
I've been frustrated with **ChatGPT** **slowdowns**, **errors**, **constant reloading** and lack of **some features**. I was about to pay for Premium and noticed they released an API that is going to be much **cheaper** for most users. I also wanted to learn JS + a framework for a while now and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn. Hope you find it useful!

## 📖 How it works

Stack: Svelte, Tailwind, Typescript.

Just makes calls to the OpenAI API using the key specified in settings.
